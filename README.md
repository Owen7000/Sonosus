# Hello!

Hey! I am Sonosus. I'm an engineering student, electronics hobbyist, and maker of random useless things.

This account holds most of my ventures into DIY synths and electronics. I am building a Kosmo format(20cm) modular system, popularised by Sam Battle/Look Mum No Computer.

I am a big fan of open source, and try and share as much as possible about my designs. If there's something missing or you have any questions, I am happy to help. Please see the contact section below.

Occasionally if I have spare PCBs to offload I will sell them on my [Tindie](https://tindie.com/stores/sonosus) store.


# Contact

You can email me directly (sonosusoshwa at gmail dot com).

Alternatively you can send me a PM on the LMNC Discourse forum - https://lookmumnocomputer.discourse.group/u/sonosus


# List of repositories

Warning! Use all files at your own risk! Many of these designs have not been tested and may cause damage to your synth or self.

If you have any queries or suggestions please do get in touch.

# Support
I've had a couple of requests from folks who want to financially support my work. I build synths and electronics in my spare time, and will always make my work open source for the world to enjoy - I publish my designs here because I want to give back to the DIY community and benefit as many people as possible. 
I don't want to advertise this widely, but since some people have asked for it, you can now tip me on [Ko-fi](ko-fi.com/sonosus). This is absolutely at your discretion - don't feel you have to, but if you do decide to donate, thank you very much.
